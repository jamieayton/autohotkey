AutoHotKey scripts for Windows PC in cojunction with the [MAX Falcon-8](http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-falcon-8-custom-programmable-mini-macropad-mechanical-keyboard-assembled.html)  

### Max Falcon-8
The Max Falcon-8 is [setup](http://www.maxkeyboard.com/download/MAX_Falcon-8_V2.1_Programmer_App.zip) to map the '1:8' programmable keys to 'Shift + F1:F8', also known as the F13:F20 keys.  

### AutoHotKey
The 'Shift + F1:F8' outputs from the Max Falcon-8 are then used as inputs for individual AutoHotKey scripts, where the output from each scripts is dependent on the program that is open - this way we can map the 8 keys in different ways dependant upon the context.
